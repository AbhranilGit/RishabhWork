This method can be particularly helpful for those who feel intimidated by drawing or painting, as it relies on selecting and combining existing elements rather than creating them from scratch.</p>

    <p content_id="content-2125f43c">To begin, gather a variety of magazines, newspapers, and personal photographs. Spend some time flipping through these materials, cutting out images, words, or phrases that resonate with you. Don't overthink this process; trust your intuition and select items that catch your eye or evoke an emotional response.</p>

    <p content_id="content-af98c207">Once you have a collection of cutouts, start arranging them on your poster board or paper. Experiment with different layouts and combinations before gluing anything down. As you work, consider the relationships between the images and words you've chosen. What story are you telling?

    <p content_id="content-336d1dcb">To create a mandala, start by drawing a circle on your paper. You can use a compass or trace around a circular object.

You might choose to use geometric shapes, organic forms, or a combination of both.</p>

    <p content_id="content-c3415ae1">As you draw, focus on the repetitive nature of the patterns you're creating. Notice how this repetition can help calm your mind and bring your attention to the present moment.
