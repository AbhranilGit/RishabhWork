<img content_id="content-5ff48889" src="PLACEHOLDER" alt="Infographic of hair follicle structure and hair growth cycle"/>

<p content_id="content-507410da">Before we dive into the remedies, it's crucial to understand the basics of hair loss. Hair loss can occur due to various factors, including genetics, hormonal changes, nutritional deficiencies, stress, and certain medical conditions. The hair growth cycle consists of three phases: anagen (growth), catagen (transition), and telogen (resting). Disruptions in this cycle can lead to excessive hair shedding or thinning.</p>

<p content_id="content-34c48686">According to a study published in JAMA Dermatology, nutritional interventions can play a significant role in managing hair loss. The research highlights the potential benefits of specific nutrients such as zinc, omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, and antioxidants in promoting hair growth. You can find more details about this study <a content_id="content-aabda461" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/article-abstract/2798840?guestAccessKey=544f5cb6-e7dc-49ac-be4b-89758cd2dc83">here</a>.</p>

<p content_id="content-fd9456fc">Now, let's explore three natural home remedies that have shown promise in combating hair loss and promoting healthier hair growth.</p>

<h2 content_id="content-02589a40" id="rosemary-oil-treatment">1. Rosemary Oil Treatment</h2>

<p content_id="content-a8f8b15d">Rosemary oil has been used for centuries as a natural remedy for hair growth. Its active compounds, including carnosic acid, rosmarinic acid, and camphor, are believed to improve blood circulation to the scalp and stimulate hair follicles.</p>

<p content_id="content-7a0686e1">To create a rosemary oil treatment:</p>

<ol content_id="content-307344e8">
    <li content_id="content-3444386f">Mix 5-10 drops of rosemary essential oil with 1 tablespoon of carrier oil.</li>

<p content_id="content-626e7d59">Aloe vera is renowned for its soothing and nourishing properties. It contains proteolytic enzymes that can help repair dead skin cells on the scalp, promoting healthier hair growth. The gel is also rich in vitamins A, C, and E, which contribute to cell turnover and promote a healthy scalp environment.</p>

<p content_id="content-3f0cf495">To create an aloe vera hair mask:</p>

<ol content_id="content-480733a6">
    <li content_id="content-5d2802b9">Extract fresh aloe vera gel from a leaf or use pure, store-bought aloe vera gel.</li>

<p content_id="content-599ff708">Onion juice might not sound like the most appealing hair treatment, but its benefits for hair growth are well-documented. Onions are rich in sulfur, which is essential for collagen production and can help in the regeneration of hair follicles. They also contain antioxidants that can help reduce oxidative stress, a factor that contributes to hair loss.</p>
