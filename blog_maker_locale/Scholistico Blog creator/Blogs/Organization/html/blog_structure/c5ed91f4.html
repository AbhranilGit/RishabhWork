<p content_id="content-b050b818">Leafy green vegetables are a cornerstone of eye-healthy nutrition. Rich in lutein and zeaxanthin, these powerful antioxidants are known to accumulate in the retina, particularly in the macula, where they act as a natural sunblock. This protective function helps filter harmful high-energy blue wavelengths of light and may help prevent age-related macular degeneration (AMD).</p>
