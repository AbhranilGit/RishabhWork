The HTML provided is already complete, well-structured, and ends correctly with `</html>`. All required sections, including the header, navigation, content, and references, are properly included and closed. There are no errors or missing tags. If you have specific changes, enhancements, or additional content you want to include, please provide the details, and I will implement them.
