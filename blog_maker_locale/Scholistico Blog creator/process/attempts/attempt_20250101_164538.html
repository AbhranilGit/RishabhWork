            <h2>1. Mandala Drawing</h2>
            <!-- DALL-E prompt: A person drawing a colorful mandala with intricate patterns, symbolizing focus and mindfulness -->
            <img src="PLACEHOLDER"/>
            <p>Mandalas, with their circular and symmetrical designs, have been used for centuries as a tool for meditation and emotional balance. Drawing a mandala can help channel grief into a structured and calming activity, allowing the mind to focus and process emotions.</p>
            <p><strong>Time Required:</strong> 30-60 minutes</p>
            <p><strong>Materials Needed:</strong> Paper, colored pencils, markers</p>
            <p>To get started, draw a circle on a blank sheet of paper and divide it into sections. Begin filling each section with patterns, shapes, or colors that resonate with your feelings. There's no right or wrong way to create a mandalaâ€”it's about the process, not the result.</p>
            <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> Creating mandalas has been shown to reduce anxiety, improve focus, and provide a meditative experience, aiding in emotional healing.</p>

            <img src="PLACEHOLDER"/>
            <p>The Emotion Color Wheel is a powerful tool for identifying and expressing the complex emotions associated with grief. By assigning colors to specific feelings, individuals can visually map their emotional state and begin to process their grief.</p>
            <p><strong>Time Required:</strong> 20-40 minutes</p>
            <p><strong>Materials Needed:</strong> Paper, crayons, or paints</p>
            <p>Start by drawing a circle and dividing it into sections. Assign a color to each emotion you are experiencing (e.g., blue for sadness, red for anger). Fill in the sections with the corresponding colors, creating a visual representation of your emotional landscape.</p>
            <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> This exercise enhances emotional awareness and provides a non-verbal way to express feelings, fostering a deeper understanding of one's grief.</p>

            <img src="PLACEHOLDER"/>
            <p>Collage making is a versatile and tactile way to explore grief. By assembling images, words, and objects that hold personal meaning, individuals can create a visual narrative of their loss and healing journey.</p>

            <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> Collage making helps externalize emotions and provides a creative outlet for storytelling, promoting emotional release and self-discovery.</p>

            <img src="PLACEHOLDER"/>
            <p>Expressive painting allows individuals to channel their emotions directly onto the canvas. This unstructured and spontaneous activity bypasses the inner critic, enabling raw emotional expression.</p>
