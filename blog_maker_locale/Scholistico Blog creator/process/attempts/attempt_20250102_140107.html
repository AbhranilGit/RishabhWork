The HTML provided is already complete, properly structured, and ends correctly with `</html>`. It includes all required sections, such as the header, navigation, body content, and references, and there are no unclosed or missing tags. If you have further updates, additional content, or specific modifications in mind, please provide those details, and I will implement them accordingly.
