    <li>Boil the ginger in 1 cup of water for 5-10 minutes.</li>

<p><strong>Time Required:</strong> 5 minutes</p>
<p><strong>Materials Needed:</strong> Baking soda, water, glass</p>

<p>Baking soda, or sodium bicarbonate, is a natural antacid that can provide quick relief from acidity. It works by neutralizing stomach acid, offering immediate comfort.

<p><strong>Materials Needed:</strong> Aloe vera leaf or pure aloe vera juice</p>

<p>Aloe vera is renowned for its soothing properties, not just for skin but also for the digestive system. Its anti-inflammatory effects can help reduce irritation in the digestive tract.

</ol>

<p><strong>Benefits:</strong> Aloe vera can help reduce inflammation in the digestive tract, potentially alleviating symptoms of acid reflux and promoting overall gut health. Its natural compounds may also aid in healing the esophagus from acid damage.</p>

<img src="PLACEHOLDER" alt="Ripe bananas and a bowl of sliced bananas"/>

<p><strong>Time Required:</strong> 5 minutes</p>
<p><strong>Materials Needed:</strong> Ripe bananas</p>

<p>Bananas are a natural antacid, rich in potassium and pectin, which help in neutralizing stomach acid. They also contain fiber, which aids in digestion and can help prevent acid reflux. The <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/gerd-diet-foods-that-help-with-acid-reflux-heartburn" class="blog-promo">Johns Hopkins Medicine guide on GERD diet</a> recommends bananas as a beneficial food for those suffering from acid reflux.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Eat a ripe banana as a snack between meals.</li>
    <li>Alternatively, add sliced bananas to your breakfast cereal or oatmeal.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Benefits:</strong> Bananas can help coat the esophagus lining, providing a protective barrier against stomach acid. Their high fiber content also promotes healthy digestion, potentially reducing the frequency of acid reflux episodes.</p>

<h2 id="fennel-seeds">5. Fennel Seeds: Ancient Digestive Support</h2>

<!-- DALL-E prompt: An image showing a small bowl of fennel seeds with a spoon, next to a cup of fennel tea. -->

<p>Fennel seeds have been used in traditional medicine for centuries to aid digestion and reduce bloating.

</ol>

<p><strong>Benefits:</strong> Fennel seeds can help reduce acid reflux by improving digestion and reducing gas. They also have a mild diuretic effect, which can help flush out toxins from the body.</p>

<!-- DALL-E prompt: An image of a bottle of apple cider vinegar next to a glass of water with a tablespoon, illustrating its use as a home remedy. -->
<img src="PLACEHOLDER" alt="Bottle of apple cider vinegar and a glass of water with a tablespoon"/>

<p><strong>Time Required:</strong> 5 minutes</p>
<p><strong>Materials Needed:</strong> Apple cider vinegar, water, honey (optional)</p>

<p>While it may seem counterintuitive, apple cider vinegar can actually help balance stomach acidity. It contains acetic acid, which may help improve digestion and reduce acid reflux symptoms. A recent <a href="https://bmjgroup.com/apple-cider-vinegar-aids-weight-management-in-obesity-small-clinical-trial-suggests/" class="blog-promo">clinical trial on apple cider vinegar</a> suggests its potential benefits for digestive health and weight management, which can indirectly affect acid reflux.</p>

    <li>Add honey to taste if desired.</li>
    <li>Drink this mixture before meals or when experiencing acid reflux symptoms.</li>

<p>Licorice root has been used in traditional medicine for centuries to treat various digestive issues, including acid reflux.

<h3>How to Use Licorice Root for Acidity:</h3>

    <li>Alternatively, take DGL supplements as directed by a healthcare provider.</li>
