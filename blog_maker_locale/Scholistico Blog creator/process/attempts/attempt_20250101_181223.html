        <p>Painting can be a powerful medium for expressing grief. The act of choosing colors and creating forms on a canvas allows for an emotional release that is both personal and profound.

    <section id="public-art-installations">
        <h2>Public Art Installations</h2>
        <!-- DALL-E prompt: A community working together on a large-scale public art installation, symbolizing collective grief and healing -->
        <img src="PLACEHOLDER"/>
        <p>Public art installations offer a collective approach to processing grief, allowing communities to come together in a shared expression of loss. These projects can transform public spaces into places of reflection and remembrance.</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Manchester_Arena_bombing">Healing Murals of Manchester</a> is a poignant example of how art can unite a community in the face of tragedy. Following the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing, local artists and survivors collaborated on murals that honored the victims and provided a therapeutic outlet for grief.</p>
        <p>Similarly, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYVcjFhpsHc">Tibetan Sand Mandala Project</a> at the University of Michigan used traditional art forms to help students process grief after campus tragedies. These installations not only offer a space for emotional expression but also serve as lasting tributes to resilience and unity.</p>
        <p>In another creative endeavor, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_of_Hull">"Sea of Hull" installation</a> by Spencer Tunick provided participants with a unique opportunity to express personal and environmental grief. While not initially designed as a grief project, many participants found the experience cathartic, using the collective art-making process to explore and release complex emotions.</p>
